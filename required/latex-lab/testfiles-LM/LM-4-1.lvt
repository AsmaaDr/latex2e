\section*{Issues/ToDos}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The MC of ``Contents'' heading show \verb=\@markboth= stuff. This is
  really a heading implementation issue
\item
  Looks like the starred headings replace Lbl by NonStruct to simplify
  coding, but that should probably cleaned up and dropped.
\item
  Activating ``math'' tagging (as this test document does), results in
  the Author name tagged as a formula in the middle of some of the  TOCI lines
  in the TOC, looks like the TOC coding and the math coding conflict
  with each other!

  The problem goes away, if the \texttt{math} is taken out, perhaps it is due
  to the dotted leaders.
